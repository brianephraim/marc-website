My great-grandfather, Rudolph, used to eat a half grapefruit with sugar every morning. He lived into his 90s and I'm sure was quite regular. He didn't drink in the morning, but this cocktail reminded me of him. Here's how to make it: 

In a shaker with ice: 

(1) shot of vodka

Fresh squeezed juice from half a grapefruit

(1) half shot of simple syrup

Shake. Garnish with a grapefruit peel.
